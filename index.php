      <h2> About </h2>

      <p class="p1">Pentatonix (often abbreviated as PTX) is an American a cappella group consisting of five vocalists
         originating from Arlington, Texas.[2] The members in this group are Avi Kaplan, Scott Hoying, Kirstin
         Maldonado, Kevin Olusola, and Mitch Grassi. Their work, which is mostly in the pop style, consists of covers of
         existing songs, sometimes in the form of medleys, along with original material. Their music is defined by their
         own arrangement style, tight vocal harmonies, extensive vocal riffing, deep and steady vocal basslines, and a
         diverse range of vocal percussion and beatboxing.</p>
